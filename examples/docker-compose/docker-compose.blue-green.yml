# Docker Compose for Blue-Green Deployment Testing
# 
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.blue-green.yml up -d
#
# To simulate Blue-Green deployment:
#   1. Deploy Green environment with new version
#   2. Test Green environment
#   3. Switch traffic from Blue to Green
#   4. Keep Blue running for quick rollback

# Blue-Green deployment simulation:
# 1. Start both environments: docker-compose -f docker-compose.blue-green.yml up -d
# 2. Traffic goes to Blue (default in nginx config)
# 3. Test Green: curl http://localhost:8000/green/health
# 4. Switch traffic: Update nginx-blue-green-lb.conf to route to Green
# 5. Reload nginx: docker exec blue-green-lb nginx -s reload
# 6. Monitor and rollback if needed by switching back to Blue
