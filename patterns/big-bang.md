## 📄 Big Bang Deployment

### 🚀 What It Is
**Big Bang Deployment** is the simplest deployment strategy — you replace the old version of the application by deploying the new version to **all servers at once**.

This approach doesn’t rely on additional infrastructure or traffic shifting — it's a one-shot update.

---

### ✅ When to Use It
- Small, internal tools or staging environments
- Startups or early-phase products where downtime is acceptable
- Apps with no user traffic during deploy windows

---

### 📊 Pros
- ✅ Easy to set up and understand
- ✅ Fast to execute
- ✅ No advanced tooling or infrastructure needed

---

### ❌ Cons
- ❌ High risk of downtime or full outage
- ❌ Rollbacks require a full redeploy
- ❌ No gradual release — all users impacted at once

---

### 🛠 Example CI/CD Snippet
🔗 **See full example**: [`big-bang-deploy.yml`](../examples/github-actions/big-bang-deploy.yml)  
📂 **Deploy script reference**: [`deploy.sh`](../../scripts/deploy.sh)

### 💡 Real-World Example
At a startup, I once used Big Bang deployments for an internal analytics dashboard. The team could tolerate a few minutes of downtime during lunch hours, and it was faster to ship features without complex infra.

This pattern was effective early on — but as the user base grew, we quickly moved to Rolling deployments to reduce risk.

### ⚠️ Gotchas to Watch For
- 🚨 Break one thing? Everything breaks.
- 🔙 Rollbacks are slow and manual unless pre-scripted.
- ⚠️ No way to isolate errors before users see them.

---

### 🧪 Validation Strategy
- ✅ Run smoke tests immediately after deploy
- ✅ Set up alerts for core services and 500s
- ✅ Ensure rollback script is tested and documented

---

### 🧠 TL;DR
Big Bang deployments are **great for speed**, **bad for safety**.
Use only when:
- The blast radius is low
- The app is not user-critical
- You’re confident in your deployment pipeline

Avoid for:
- Production systems with customers
- Complex infrastructure
