# 📦 Deployment Patterns Guide

Welcome to your comprehensive guide on **deployment patterns** — designed to teach, reinforce, and showcase best practices in production deployments for SREs and DevOps engineers.

This repository provides detailed implementations, real-world examples, and practical tools for five foundational deployment strategies.

---

## 🎯 Deployment Patterns Covered

| Pattern | Status | Risk Level | Complexity | Use Case |
|---------|--------|------------|------------|----------|
| **[Big Bang](patterns/big-bang.md)** | ✅ Complete | 🔴 High | 🟢 Low | Internal tools, scheduled maintenance |
| **[Rolling](patterns/rolling.md)** | ✅ Complete | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | Production APIs, zero-downtime required |
| **Blue-Green** | 🚧 Planned | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium | Critical systems, instant rollback |
| **Canary** | 🚧 Planned | 🟢 Low | 🔴 High | User validation, gradual rollouts |
| **Feature Flags** | 🚧 Planned | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 High | A/B testing, runtime control |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Choose Your Pattern
```bash
# Not sure which pattern to use? 
cat docs/decision-guide.md

# For rapid development
./scripts/deploy.sh                    # Big Bang

# For production safety  
./scripts/rolling-batch-deploy.sh      # Rolling
```

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# Add to your .github/workflows/
- uses: ./.github/workflows/big-bang-deploy.yml
  with:
    environment: production
    
- uses: ./.github/workflows/rolling-deploy.yml
  with:
    batch_size: 2
    environment: production
```

### Kubernetes/Helm Deployment
```bash
# Big Bang deployment
helm install myapp ./examples/helm-deployments/big-bang-chart

# Rolling deployment
helm install myapp ./examples/helm-deployments/rolling-chart
```

## ✨ Enhanced Features

### 🔍 Visual Learning
Each pattern includes ASCII diagrams showing the deployment flow:
```
Big Bang: v1 → [DOWNTIME] → v2
Rolling:  v1 → v1+v2 → v2 (gradual)
```

### 🛡️ Production-Ready Scripts
- **Health check validation** between deployment steps
- **Automatic rollback** on failure detection
- **Comprehensive logging** and error handling
- **Configurable batch sizes** and timeouts

### 📊 Monitoring Integration
- **Prometheus alerts** for deployment failures
- **Grafana dashboards** for deployment visualization
- **Custom metrics** for deployment success rates

### 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code
- **Helm charts** for Kubernetes deployments
- **GitHub Actions workflows** for CI/CD integration
- **Docker Compose** examples for local testing

---

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner → Intermediate
1. **Start with Big Bang** - Understand the basics
2. **Add Rolling Deployments** - Learn zero-downtime patterns
3. **Implement Monitoring** - Add observability

### Intermediate → Advanced  
4. **Blue-Green Strategy** - Master instant rollbacks
5. **Canary Deployments** - Gradual user validation
6. **Feature Flags** - Runtime control and experimentation

---

## 🏭 Real-World Context

### Startup Journey (Personal Experience)
**Phase 1**: Started with Big Bang for internal dashboard (50 users)
- ✅ Fast iteration, acceptable downtime during lunch
- ❌ User complaints led to better patterns

**Phase 2**: Adopted Rolling for customer-facing API (1K users)  
- ✅ Zero downtime, improved confidence
- ❌ Needed better validation for critical features

**Phase 3**: Blue-Green for payment system (10K users)
- ✅ Instant rollback capability
- ❌ Higher infrastructure costs

### Industry Examples
- **Netflix**: Canary + Feature Flags for recommendation engine
- **GitHub**: Rolling deployments for web application
- **Stripe**: Blue-Green for payment processing systems

## 🔧 Implementation Examples

### Big Bang Script Usage
```bash
# Standard deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh v2.0.0

# With custom health check
HEALTH_CHECK_URL=https://api.example.com/health ./scripts/deploy.sh v2.0.0

# Emergency rollback
./scripts/deploy.sh v1.9.0 --rollback
```

### Rolling Deployment Options
```bash
# Small batches (safer)
./scripts/rolling-batch-deploy.sh v2.0.0 1

# Larger batches (faster)
./scripts/rolling-batch-deploy.sh v2.0.0 3

# Disable auto-rollback
ROLLBACK_ON_FAILURE=false ./scripts/rolling-batch-deploy.sh v2.0.0 2
```

## 📈 Metrics & Success Criteria

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Target 99.5%
- **Mean Time to Deploy (MTTD)**: < 10 minutes
- **Mean Time to Rollback (MTTR)**: < 5 minutes
- **Zero Downtime Percentage**: 100% for rolling/blue-green

### Monitoring Dashboards
Each pattern includes:
- 📊 **Deployment progress tracking**
- 🚨 **Failure rate monitoring** 
- ⏱️ **Performance impact analysis**
- 🔄 **Rollback success metrics**

---

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Quick Rollback Commands
```bash
# Big Bang rollback
./scripts/deploy.sh --rollback

# Rolling deployment halt
kubectl rollout pause deployment/myapp

# Kubernetes rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp
```

### Incident Response
1. **Identify the issue** (monitoring alerts)
2. **Assess impact** (error rates, user reports)
3. **Execute rollback** (pattern-specific procedure)
4. **Validate recovery** (health checks, smoke tests)
5. **Post-incident review** (what went wrong, improvements)

---

## 🤝 Contributing

### Adding New Patterns
